## Description

> Challenge #12 Create a CMS using SQL and node.js

## Introduction 
The challenge this week is to build a command-line application to manage a company's database of employees using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Challenges

This challenge was extremely difficult for me. I have had such a hard time grasping MySQL. This was a very tricky syntax for me to get down. Unfortunatley i still did have a bug or two that i couldnt work out but i wanted to be able to turn in something instead of nothing. The one bug that i do hope to eventually get worked out is on the Delete Employee function. It acts like it deletes it and console logs it right but it doesnt actually update the table correctly.

## Victories

Getting this application to even work has been the greatest victory for me. I was able to work out most of the code on my own without help. I do enjoy getting to work with databases and testing out the code through Insomnia Core.
